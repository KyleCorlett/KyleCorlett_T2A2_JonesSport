# Kyle Corlett T2A2 Marketplace Project - Jones Sport Store

## Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app

I am building this app as an ecommerce store for a aftermarket automotive company to get their products out to their customers in a neat easy way. It will allow the supplier to log into the website add and remove products, as well as keep track of stock levels and orders placed. 

The customers will also be able to log into the website and see their previous orders and keep track of their current orders placed, along with storing their shipping information for future orders to keep checkout easier. It will also have a built in mailing service to let signed up customers know about new products and restock of products.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?

This particular web app needs to be created to give the company a better chance at growing and become a bigger ecommerce store by having the availability to scale to a larger system and get off relying on pre built websites.
